As a team, we decided that we are going to assign primary roles to different members of the team with members temporarily filling other roles as necessary. Jesse, Indy and Luke will primarily work on the front end of the application, while Alec and Cristhian will primarily work on the backend of the application. Luke will float from the frontend to help in the back end as necessary. Alec will float from the backend to help in the frontend as necessary.

Our team will meet two times a week during the hours of 4 PM to 6 PM. Each of us will be assigned to appropriate roles mitigating the project. We will keep our team up to date with adjustments and fill in for members who cant meet at a specific date or time. Most of our team meeting will be held through Discord and Slack channels.

The main goal we came up with collectively is to improve and work on our teamwork skills with a focus on communication. Working on our teamwork abilities will not only allow this class to move as efficiently as possible, but it is also an extremely valuable skillset within the industry. Every week we will have a brief valuation of our teamwork for that week. This will help insure we are still working towards our agreed goal.

When it comes to decision making, we have decided that "majority rules" will ultimately be the best approach for our team. With 5 members, we will never reach a tied vote, and decision making will be simple and quick. Unanimous votes are tedious and unlikely with a team like ours. It is our hope to avoid unnecessary conflict and have the ability to approach issues like professionals.

As a great team that we are, we have the obligation to support each other so that we all fulfill the assigned tasks. If someone is not progressing or is having a hard time, the one who finished everything on their part can help by giving advice and resources so that they can achieve this goal and we can advance as a team.
