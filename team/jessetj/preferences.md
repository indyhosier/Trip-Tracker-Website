# Preferences for _Jesse Jason_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Typically able to reach me through Discord and Slack between 10am and 10pm!
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that my team will be able to complete our goals to the best of our ability, 101% effort.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Teamwork in the software industry is crucial and is something that you can only learn through experience.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * There is almost always conflict in teamwork. Communication is a learned skill.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Like in all conflict there is compromise. All teammates should address these differences transparently.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * We've all seen Dave's grading structure. I don't see this as being an issue.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * From each member? Probably 10-15 hours a week I'd guess.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Preferences! Duh!
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * No mercy. Call em out, finish the work. Deadlines are hard, failure is harder.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Majority rules, It is a learning experience for most of us, but if it runs, it runs.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think this is how we will split the work groups in the team.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I'd say weekly update on when the team can meet is probably best. My schedule fluctuates a lot.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Twice a week should be sufficient. That'll satisfy the beginning, middle, and end of each sprint.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * That'll reveal itself as time permits. Changes to major features should be discussed.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Majority rules! We have enough members where there won't be tied votes, it's only fair
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * The person who has a problem with that should be the one to address that, for sure.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Because of who I am, I actually don't mind that. I like leadership and organization.
