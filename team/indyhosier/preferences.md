   * I expect my team to communicate well, address any issues or conflicts accordingly, and complete the project on time.
3. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Personally, I hope to provide input where I can and be sure to ask my team members for any help that I may need. 
4. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Our team may encounter obsatacles of new experience, as all of us are fairly new to this subject and the languages that are incorparated into this course.
5. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If someone wants to try to achieve at a higher level, I hope they do so at their own desire. I hope to be sure to communicate our own personal goals for the course and not to harm each others intentions. Mainly, I hope to pass this course no matter what.
6. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe in free speech for our team and if they wish to achieve at a higher rate, then that is fine. However, our team should be able to communicate properly and each put our individual effort in. 
7. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I would estimate 5-10 hours a week to complete the project on time.
8. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I believe our team should divide into groups based on experience and what we intend on learning.
9. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Other team members will conquer and divide to make sure we don't fall too far behind and tackle the issue with communication and teamwork.
10. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * The team should express communication on the quality of work and if they want to go above and beyond, they should. However, we shall not let it affect compromising the entire project.
11. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Everyone will have different work ethics, however we must be patient and be willing to offer help where it is needed.
12. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would like to meet at least once or twice a week outside of class as I feel it is necessary for us to communicate and succeed at a high level.
13. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Our team should probably meet two or three times a week if we are able to manage it. 
14. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I will not need approval of every decision, however I would like to be informed of everything that is essential to the project so we can handle the situation if it were to go wrong.
15. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We should decide as a group what is most important to our grades, the project and the course. If there is still diagreement, majority is usually a good suite to follow. 
16. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If they are doing a good job at communicating what they are doing, I believe we should let them lead our group to complete our project. However, if it compromises us from a learning experience we shall deal with it as a team.
17. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I shall bring it up with my teammates and ask them for more resources/contribution.
