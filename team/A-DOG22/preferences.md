# Preferences for _Alec Watkins_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text or Snapchat will be the easiest way to reach me, I will generally respond anytime before 10ish
2. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think that my team will accomplish a lot and have high expectations, we have already started off on a good start with communicating and meeting up.
3. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal is to just ask question. I can usually be timid when asking question thinking that everyone will think that I or the question is stupid. I am going to really make the effort to ask questions whenever I am confused.
4. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I think we will encounter general communication obstacles, where someone might be rude or condescending which will impede both my and the team goals.
5. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think trying to influence everybody to do 'better' is always in everyones best interest. I think it is better to strive for the A and be satisfied with the B.
6. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If you are continuing to better your own part then yes, but you shouldnt overstep the bounds of other people either asking them to do a great a deal extra of work and also not just doing the work for someone else.
7. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I think it will probably take about 10+ hours per week
8. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we will all find a compromise that we are all equally happy with.
9. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The other team members will equally take up the work in order to complete that part, but ensure that we are having the conversations back to expectations of what need to be doing to each carry the our own wait, and if it is a recurring issue we will talk to Dave.
10. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think you should try to find a compromise or go with what the majority would like to do.
11. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will deal with it with patience, and open communication. I think communication will be the main key to a successful group.
12. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We already have had a couple of meetings outside of class, so yes.
13. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should probably meet at least 3 times a week outside of class.
14. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I dont think we will need approval for every decision, just making sure everyone is informed after making the decision.
15. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * See if there is anyway to compromise, otherwise go with the majority I guess.
16. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I might bring up if there is more ways that the rest of us can be dediligated more work and if everyone agrees that 1 person is taking see what the rest of the group would like to do.
17. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will reach out to the other group members and try to get them to contribute more and maybe find more personalized ways each person may need to be motivated, and if it continues to be an then I will reach out to Dave.
