## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code

* Minimize code smells and duplication.

### Test Driven Development
* Write the tests before the code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is 70%

### Processes
* Incremental development.  No big bangs.
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
# Server Settings
Show the other server settings to the user, not just the server name and host:port.
# Interoperability 
There is a system requirement that each client must work with servers from other teams and each server must work with clients from other teams. Complete interoperability testing with other teams per the assignment. Exchange information with the other teams and make corrections as necessary.
# User Experience
Survey users outside this class to learn more about their experience using your application and identify changes to improve their user experience. Each student should get feedback from one other person outside the class and post their notes per the assignment. Possible areas of improvement that will be graded on include: mobile user format responsive to different sizes and orientations, eliminate clutter, show the fewest visual elements possible at a time, progressive disclosure of information to user, easy navigation, minimal click to achieve something, minimal scrolling required, meaningful icons and labels, and consistent with CSU web style guidelines.
# Modify Tour
The user would like to make changes to the tour:
* Let the user select a new starting location while maintaining the order of the destinations.
* Let the user reverse the order of the destinations from the starting location.
* Let the user reorder individual destinations.
* Let the user remove destinations.
* Let the user add notes about a destination or correct mistakes in the existing information about a place. Preserve this information when written to a file.

### Epics not completed 
- Modify Tour

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
We were able to complete 3 of our planned epics, and almost finished the last epic. We also worked well as a team and put a lot of effort into what we completed. We were all feeling extreme effects of burnout and worked well on overcoming those as a group and recognizing how much we can do without overwhelming ourselves. Our user interface is also much better than it was after sprint four.

### Things we need to improve
Our team still struggled a bit with procrastination, which is likely due to our members being exhausted from the long online semester, but our communication was really good and we still finished everything we had planned, and then some. We all did not work as hard as previously, especitally due to burnout. If we were to continue we would take a good break to come back remotivated to put out our best work.

### One thing we will change next time
We could still complete tasks and epics in more of a timely manner, just to get on top of things a little faster. Starting strong could have been more productive for us.
