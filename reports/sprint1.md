## Policies and Github Etiquette

  1) Make sure there is an issue for your task. There should already be one for each, but make one if necessary.
  2) Create a new branch.
  3) Checkout your branch locally.
  4) Add tests if necessary and make your changes.
  5) Ensure all tests pass an your feature works as designed before submitting a pull request.
  6) Submit pull request, assign a teammate to review, and link your issue. Your teammate should be the one that merges the branch. Never merge your own branch.
   


## Planned Epics

### Team Identification:
The team needs to pick a name that identifies it to the rest of our organization.<br>
Please update the team ID in the browser tab/HTML title and the application header and footer.

### About:
Users want to know about the team that built the product. We need to add an image and mission statement for the team. Each member of the team will need to add an image of themself, their name, and a short bio to the page.<br>
This needs to be done in a consistent style, format and voice for all content.

### Trip:
Show the most recent list of clicks on the map with the most recent at the top. Add feature that allows a user to clear all individual entries.

### Maps:
Add a feature that remembers a selected map for future sessions.

### Place Details:
Please use reverse gecoding to convert lat/long into textual description. Show this additional information on the marker. Show this additional information in the history.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
The first sprint went better than expected. While we were not able to complete all five epics, we were able to complete three of them without any real problems. Everyone got their assigned work done in a timely manner and nobody broke the main branch. The team met regularly throughout the sprint and we were able to compromise to overcome the challenges we faced as a team. 


#### Things that we need to improve
While we thought we had a pretty successful sprint 1, we all still believe that there is always room for improvement no matter how well things go in any environment. The first thing we would like to improve on is communicating more effectively, especially in terms of assigning ZenHub tasks. We would like to consult and distribute tasks and the beginning of every epic rather than assigning tasks as we go. Another thing we are planning to improve is a regularly scheduled meeting time. This will ensure everybody will be able to come to every meeting and we can make the most efficient use of our time. We will continue and increase our communication through slack as well. The last thing we will be improving on is distributing the work more evenly across all team members.


#### One thing we will change next time
Our team will communicate more effectively about the work that needs to be completed. In the future, all team members will communicate the work they are taking by properly self-assigning the work, moving it to the in-progress column in ZenHub, and informing the team that they are taking the task via Slack.
